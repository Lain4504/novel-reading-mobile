## Contributing

We welcome contributions to LightNovelReader! Here's how you can get involved:

### Getting Started

2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/LightNovelReader.git`
3. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes and test them.
5. Commit your changes following the commit guidelines below.
6. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. Open a Pull Request to the `refactoring` branch.

### Commit Guidelines
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive.
- If your change affects the version, update it in `app/build.gradle.kts`.

### Version Management
Versions are managed in `app/build.gradle.kts`:
- `versionNameStr`: The public version (e.g., "1.3.1"). Follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).
- `debugNumber`: Increment for development builds (0 for releases).
- `versionCode`: Auto-calculated as major*1000000 + minor*10000 + patch*1000 + debugNumber.

For releases, update `versionNameStr` and reset `debugNumber` to 0.
